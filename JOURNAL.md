## 11/3/2025 - read over the hacker card guide and brainstormed ideas  

basically just spend the time reading over the guide/installing tools to get a basic idea of how the project will work and then spent some time brainstorming the general design. had the idea of doing a vertical business card as horizontal is whats usually seen and I feel like it could work better with the nfc design. tried brainstorming some designs and looked on pintrest for what other vertical business cards look like. i've attached a basic design idea below but im not completely sure if the color overlays work like that and was planning to test when i start building.![Untitled6_20251103212137](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--437a3a20a9c8aafd8157bca6cd705a45df90d412/Untitled6_20251103212137.PNG)
