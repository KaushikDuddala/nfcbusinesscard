## 11/3/2025 - read over the hacker card guide and brainstormed ideas  

basically just spend the time reading over the guide/installing tools to get a basic idea of how the project will work and then spent some time brainstorming the general design. had the idea of doing a vertical business card as horizontal is whats usually seen and I feel like it could work better with the nfc design. tried brainstorming some designs and looked on pintrest for what other vertical business cards look like. i've attached a basic design idea below but im not completely sure if the color overlays work like that and was planning to test when i start building.![Untitled6_20251103212137](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--437a3a20a9c8aafd8157bca6cd705a45df90d412/Untitled6_20251103212137.PNG)
  

## 11/4/2025 - created the pcb!!!  

lowkey took a while because i kept going back and forth in designs but the essential idea (from a pintrest inspo) was to have the back of the card with just a simple logo in the middle which eventually became a qr code in my design and then the front would have some text in the middle with some kind of outline (was originanlly hoping to have some layered stuff but realized that didnt really work on pcb design) and then a different colored area at the bottom with a qr code and the nfc tag. i was also going back and forth on colors since my original idea was a purple design but i quickly realized that purple was actually pretty mid looking on the pcb since it was like a bright purple and black also looked kinda mid so i eventually decided on white and used some gold so overall its a white and gold color scheme. i kinda messed up on routing since originally i just did auto router before i moved everything around and then instead of hitting control z i just deleted the traces and then kept finding leftover traces for a while unfortunately. the vertical design did end up going well in my opinion and im hoping that works out well for when im actually able to use it too. here's what the final design maybe looks like: ![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 10.39.02 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODMzNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b81e259c33f2a6298461996ba15e596e6b7916ff/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%2010.39.02%E2%80%AFAM.png)![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 10.39.38 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODMzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--775c8ea3bfed1de9ce277053802199387fa8e96c/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%2010.39.38%E2%80%AFAM.png)

overall think it's decent but im not completely sure about the info i kept since i also put like my insta username on there lol but we'll see. i'm gonna also have to design a site for the qr code/nfc to lead to since right now it just leads to a domain i own but theres nothing actually there.
